        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a sophomore who is 15 years old attending Thomas A. Edison CTE HS. In my high school I have a shop class which is titled Web App Design & Development. Throughout high school I have improved and gained skills that only stengthened me,
        such as leadership, organization and teamwork. It also made me realize and idenitify my downsides which are my personality being a little too strong and I can be a little too straight forward when it comes to group projects. 
        Apart from school I also have other interests which are cooking, fashion, cosmetology and music. I would describe my personality as friendly, kind and honest. </p>

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p> In my future, I see myself working in the education field whether it would be a counselor or what would be preferred is a teacher. I would like to aim to be a professor in university or a teacher in high school guiding and educating younger
        minds. Regardless, technology carries a heavy presence within todays contemporary society so you can imagine by the time I get to my future career I will need to be able to utilize technology in my career. As an educator I know technology
        will be all around me such as smartboards, laptops, phones, etc. </p>

        <h3>Coding and My Life</h3>        
        <p> Technology has made a huge impact on my life because it present with me for academics, personal life an basically 24/7. I always have my phone on me which allows me to communicate easily, allows me to complete tasks on the go and use
        it for entertainment purposes. Coding has produced apps I use everyday and tend to rely on. These apps hold significant value in my everyday life because it is how I get inspired, learn about new topics, stay on track but also have fun. </p>
